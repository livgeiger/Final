            <h1>Why digital art?</h1>
            <p>Digital art allows a freedom of expression that is freeing to those that struggle with experimentaion within their art. Working in a digital medium allows a much lower stakes arena to play around with new styles. If you love working with oils on canvas, but are wondering about trying a new style (such as the vintage paint by number inspired pieces on the home page,) you can play around with the style before committing to using expensive paints and canvas. For me, digital collage was a huge win, as I'm far too anxious to do traditional collage successfully. With digital, you don't have to worry about using that cool picture from the vintage magazine that you love, only to realize later you wish you had used it in a different way or in a different piece. You can scan in all those cool photos you have from your traditional media sorces, and also use photos you've taken, open source images, and museum archives to create works that don't give room for any FOMO of the other pieces you could have used them for. You can reuse them countless times until you find the exact right place for them!  </p>
